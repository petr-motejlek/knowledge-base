# ananas analytics

[Ananas Analytics](https://github.com/ananas-analytics/ananas-desktop) is a platform that can be used
for quick data visualization using either files or cloud-based database engines
as its data store. For scalability, the execution can be ran inside e.g. Apache
Spark. But by default, the execution itself always takes place on the desktop.
One of the goals of the platform is to be nice and easy to use by an end user,
even though it still retains features for developers and power users to utilize.

# android

## Enable Developer Mode

This procedure only applies to a real Android device. AVD (Android Virtual
Devices aka emulators) have the Developer mode enabled by default.

1.  Go into _Settings_ and locate a field called `Build Number` (it's in
    different places on different phones, but usually it sits somewhere under
    _About_)
2.  Click on the field multiple times
    1.  At some point a message will pop up saying `You are now 3 steps away
        from being a developer` – continue clicking...
    2.  A message will pop up saying `You are now a developer!`
3.  Go into _Settings,_ locate a section called `Developer options` and enter it
4.  Enable (check) `Allow USB debugging` and confirm whatever dialog pops up
5.  Disable (uncheck) `Verify apps over USB`
6.  Optionally you might want to enable `Stay awake` (so that the screen will
    not go into sleep mode while charging (i.e. connected to wall outlet or PC))

## Install CA cert from phone storage/SD card

*   Xiaomi Mi Note 2
    *   The procedure is the same as for any other Android system, however, you
        first need to go into Installed Apps and **enable** the _Documents_ app
        (it might be at the very bottom of the list of installed apps). If you
        don't do this, the stock Xiaomi app will prohibit you from installing
        the certificates with a strange almost random toast message "Couldn't
        install the certificate because the file couldn't be read"

# [anka (aka veertu)](https://ankadoc.bitbucket.io/creating-vms/)

*   Commercial product using the Hypervisor.framework library on MacOS to
    automate deployment of virtualized macOS.
    *   Due to the nature of the library, the VMs are really low level (using
        para-virtualized hardware/drivers where possible), and theoretically are
        as fast as VMs can ever be.
*   Has support for running on developers machine as well as in a cluster.
    *   The system takes care of the tediousness of installing macOS on the VMs.
        After requesting a VM, one only has to wait for the installation to
        finish, and one eventually gets an installed VM (without having to
        manually click through the steps).
    *   One can use either VNC, SSH or an integrated Anka shell to control the
        VMs (install additional software, reconfigure, ...).
*   Has support for custom bootstrapping of the VMs (e.g. install Xcode).

# ansible

[ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_getting_started.html)
is a very nice tool (part of Red Hat's suite) that makes it super easy to
control and deploy infrastructure (servers, switches, ...). It's extremely
lightweight (you just need `pip` to install it and then `ssh`) and can be very
easily used to simply query things such as IP addresses, hostnames, ... from
remote machines. So, even if you don't plan to control any device with it, you
can still take advantage of its querying capability just as easily. All you need
is `pip` and `ssh` :).

I might be wrong, but I think Ansible's biggest strength is that one can easily
use it to control machines and infrastructure that already exist. When you want
to do infrastructure as a code, terraform might be a better choice, especially
with containers and/or virtualization.

## paxos

Paxos is one of the algorithms used by distributed systems to reach consensus
(e.g. consistency).

It is probably the oldest, published by Leslie Lamport, who actually originally
tried to disprove the algorithm. Well, what do you know? He ended up proving
it works.

Recently, a slightly different algorithm, Raft, has seend an uprise in popularity,
so it might be worth a while to check it out too.

## raft

Raft is a younger competitor to the Paxos consensus algorithm. It is commonly
referred by people as "being simpler to understand and implement".

## making files "hidden" from Git's change detection

Should you ever need to "hide" changes in certain files from git's automated change detection, you can
mark those files using `git update-index --skip-worktree ...`, which will make Git not try to detect
any changes in them. When checking out or merging a different branch into the working tree, it will,
however, properly realize that the file has changed and prevent you from accidentally overwriting it.

An open source tool similar in nature to teleconsole. You wrap a terminal

  control the session. You might for instance use this for some kind of
  GUI-oriented API server.

[Graphene for Python](https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-python/0-introduction/).
The ecosystem also comes with a couple client-side libraries as well as IDEs and
plugins.

It is very useful for micro-service applications, but can be just as easily used
for monolithic ones too.

# [gRPC](https://grpc.io/)

Built on top of Protocol Buffers, [gRPC](https://grpc.io) is a multi-language
client-server framework/library that makes it possible to specify the protocol,
then, whenever you need, generate stubs for all clients & servers you will ever
want. They claim it is usable for both close-by scenarios (such as microservices
talking to each other) as well as long-distance dating. Examples of supported
[languages](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/) for both client/server include:
JavaScript (Node), Python, Java, Go, C++, ... you still readin'? What else do
you need? :)

# InfluxDB

Marketing: InfluxDB is a time series database designed to handle high write and
query loads. It is an integral component of the TICK stack. InfluxDB is meant
to be used as a backing store for any use case involving large amounts of
timestamped data, including DevOps monitoring, application metrics, IoT sensor
data, and real-time analytics.

## Axios

*   HTTP AJAX Request Library
    *   [Making friends of VueJS and Axios](https://alligator.io/vuejs/rest-api-axios/)

## [babel](https://babeljs.io/setup#installation)

[babel](https://babeljs.io/setup#installation) is a transpiler for JavaScript
that amongst other things, allows one to write code using the latest syntactic
sugars, while keeping the resulting code compatible with engines that do not
support those features (as long as Babel is able to transpile them).

## [browserlist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist)

"The config to share target browsers and Node.js versions between different front-end tools."

## [copy-to-clipboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/copy-to-clipboard)

[copy-to-clipboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/copy-to-clipboard) is
a JavaScript library for copying things into user's clipboard through their
browser. TypeScript typings are included.

## [dockerode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dockerode)

[dockerode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dockerode) is a JavaScript library for
communicating with Docker Engine. For TypeScript,
[@types/dockerode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/dockerode) are
available.

## [execa](https://www.npmjs.com/package/execa)

[execa](https://www.npmjs.com/package/execa) is a JavaScript library/wrapper
that makes spawning processes a breeze (has a Promise-like and synchronous
interfaces, no weird callbacks). TypeScript typings are included.

## [eslint](https://eslint.org)

[eslint](https://eslint.org) is a JavaScript linter.

## [fflate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fflate)

Compression/decompression library written in pure JavaScript, hence
it does not require any specific underlying library, and can thus run
even in the browser.

I personally like it, since I've noticed that NodeJS's Gzip standard library
tends to leak file descriptors (they hang around until the process gets
reaped), and `fflate` does not suffer from that. And the devs claim
it can even be faster in some occasions than the standard library.

It contains integrated TypeScript types in the main package.

## [genversion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/genversion)

[genversion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/genversion) is a handy JavaScript
tool that's able to take a look at your `package.json` file, read the version
from it, and store it in a regular `.js` file that can then be imported from
both JavaScript and TypeScript (use the `--es6` command-line flag).

## [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start)

Put simply, [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start) is
an alternative to GNU Make when it comes to JavaScript-based projects.

## [js-yaml](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-yaml)

[js-yaml](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-yaml) is a JavaScript library for
encoding and decoding YAML. TypeScript typings are available as
[@types/js-yaml](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/js-yaml).

## [knex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/knex)

[knex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/knex) is a JavaScript library for accessing
SQL databases (MS SQL (Azure included), MySQL, PgSQL, ...). Where it really
outshines all the others is the superb builder interface and integrated schema
migration. TypeScript typings are included.

## nodejs (aka node.js)

### node version manager

There's a bunch of tools that have more or less the same objective: for one to be
able to quickly and easily switch between different versions of Node on their
machine. Such as

```bash
$ nvm install 14   # install the latest NodeJS 14
$ nvm use 14   # use the already installed NodeJS 14 version
$ nvm use   # use whatever NodeJS version is expected in the project's .nvmrc file
```

* [nvm-sh](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) -- the original that started it all (works on most standard Unix shells, such as Bash, ZSH, ...)
* [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) -- a Windows clone with the most similar command-line interface, but still somewhat different
* [nvm for PowerShell](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/nvm) -- a clone that works on Powershell; has a different interface, but is also usable to get the job done

### [why-is-node-running](https://www.npmjs.com/package/why-is-node-running)

Sometimes, a NodeJS process just hangs. This is usually caused by an unawaited promise,
or unclosed database connection, etc. I never found it easy enough to figure out which
exactly it is. `why-is-node-running` can help.

The one thing I really like about it is that it can be easily used without changing the
underlying sources. It is possible to simply run `node` (or `nodemon`)
with `-r` `why-is-node-running/include` as extra arguments, and then, when the process
remains hanging, simply `kill -SIGUSR1` the process, and it will print out a report.

## [pg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg)

[pg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg) is a JavaScript library providing the
very basic PgSQL client bindings. Most of the higher-level libraries will
require you to install this in order to be able to talk to PgSQL, so that's why
it's here for reference, but  <ac:link></ac:link>  would not recommend anyone
actually use this alone. It is too basic. Little to no support for building
queries. TypeScript typings available in
[@types/pg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/pg).

## [prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier)

[prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) is a code-formatter. It
supports JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, YAML, HTLM, CSS, VueJS, and others.

## [ramda](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ramda)

[ramda](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ramda) is a JavaScript library providing
a lot of simple to very complex functions that make functional programming
easier. If you also enjoy functional programming, this is one of the libraries
to get. TypeScript typings are available in
[@types/ramda](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/ramda).

## [ramda-adjunct](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ramda-adjunct)

[ramda-adjunct](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ramda-adjunct) is a complementary
(much smaller in comparison) JavaScript library to _ramda_. TypeScript typings
are included.

simulate the actual command-line tar syntax, to make it easier to use for
people familiar with tar. TypeScript typings are available as
[@types/tar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/tar).

## [tar-stream](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tar-stream)

[tar-stream](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tar-stream) is a generator (creation)
and parser (decompression) for tar files. It is seemingly faster than tar
(aka node-tar) and uses streams. TypeScript typings are available as
[@types/tar-stream](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/tar-stream).

## [tmp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tmp)

[tmp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tmp) is a JavaScript library for creating
temporary files directories nodejs. TypeScript typings are available as
[@types/tmp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/tmp).

## [untildify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/untildify)

[untildify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/untildify) is a JavaScript library
that makes it easy to expand ~ (tilda) in filesystem paths (which is something
  a shell normally does, but people have gotten used to using it, because it's
  short) to the user's home directory. TypeScript typings are included.

*   [Tips for Unit Testing Vue Components with Jest, post by Achhunna Mali](https://medium.com/swlh/tips-on-unit-testing-vue-components-with-jest-e68ff6a28bb5)
    * I believe the post is worth reading, to understand how one can take a Vue component and write tests against it. However, I do also believe that one
      should not (when possible) couple their code too much to any given framework. Hence, try to keep the minimum amount of logic that you actually need to 
      test inside the component, and extract as much as you can outside of it. It is much easier to test your own code the layout of which you can always
      change, rather than the layout that is imposed on you by Vue's authors.

## [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/getting_started/)

[helm](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/getting_started/) is a tool
that makes it possible to write your Kubernetes deployments (services, secrets,
  actual deployments, ...) as code. It utilizes Go's templating language.

### Values Schema

Helm allows to specify a JSON schema to restrict/validate input variables for
your charts. JSON can be a bit too wordy to use. It is possible to write the
schema in YAML and to convert it into the JSON format quite easily, though.
One example using pyyaml is:

```bash
$ <values.schema.yaml python -c "import json; import sys; import yaml; json.dump(yaml.load(sys.stdin), sys.stdout, indent=2)" >values.schema.json
```

## [k8s_gateway](https://github.com/ori-edge/k8s_gateway)

[k8s_gateway](https://github.com/ori-edge/k8s_gateway) is a really cool extension to any k8s cluster,
becaue it allows external DNS resolution for all service and ingress resources.

be used to actually talk to Kubernetes, as well as reading and creating configuration files.

## [rancher](https://rancher.com/)

Rancher is a set of utilities for spinning up and maintaining Docker and
Kubernetes clusters in no time.

### [RancherOS](https://rancher.com/rancher-os/)

RancherOS is very similar in nature to CoreOS, in that it gives one the ability
to quickly spin up a Linux machine with Docker Engine up and running. It
supports cloud config (ie. you can provide it with a config file and it will set
up itself based on that, unattended).

It can run either on a physical machine, VM or in the cloud.

### [Rancher Kubernetes Environment](https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/) (aka RKE)

RKE is a tool that can either be used standalone or in conjunction with
RancherOS and allows one to upgrade their running Docker Engine installation to
a Kubernetes installation. Again, it is configurable upfront.

      it, failing (because they were forcing the teams into bad habbits). I have also seen it being done only be the teams,
      failing (because management did not care and did not allow changes to happen based on those metrics' results).

# minio

[minio](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-client-quickstart-guide.html) is both an
AWS S3-compatible server as well as client that can be used to interact with the
files inside S3-compatible servers. It can even mount an S3 bucket as a regular
file system.

# [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)

[mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) is the tool you've been looking
for if you've ever need to develop SSL-enabled services and hated there never
was an easy way to create the certificates. _mkcert_ comes to the rescue. It
allows one to generate a local CA (installs it as trusted into system store,
Java keystore, ...) and then generate as many server-side certificates as one
needs. It supports wildcards and multiple SANs, but that's too obvious :).

*   In case you need a client auth cert (like the ones for PgSQL clients), as
of now, mkcert does not generate certificates with CN (used by PgSQL server to
authenticate you). There's
a [PR open](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/pull/258) (that nobody yet
reviewed nor merged). For the time being, it is possible to use the rpeo
directly to install the tool using Go:
`go get [github.com/antong/mkcert](https://github.com/antong/mkcert)`

# mongodb

"MongoDB is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for
modern application developers and for the cloud era. No database makes you

# [mozilla SSL configuration generator](https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/#server=awselb&server-version=2014.2.19&config=modern)

_Mozilla SSL Configuration Generator_ is a web tool that can be used to quickly
generate SSL-enabling configuration snippets for popular web-servers
(e.g. Nginx) and providers (e.g. AWS Load Balancer). Have you ever been looking
for the super-safe-super-secure-and-trustworthy SSL configuration snippet for
your favorite web server? They have it! (Unless that web server is Ghost, in
which case you are "[attached to another object by an inclined plane, wrapped helically around an axis](https://the-big-bang-theory.com/quotes/character/Leonard/)").

# [neo4j](https://neo4j.com/developer/get-started/)

# [performance co-pilot](https://pcp.io/index.html)

PCP, for short, is an attempt to put together the power behind tools like
htop, iotop, ... not only at runtime, but also to allow later processing of
the collected data.

# php

## [composer](http://getcomposer.org/)

[Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) is dependency manager for the PHP
programming language. Similar in nature to JavaScript's NPM or Ruby's Gems.

## [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)

If you already use Nette (or parts of it), I think this is so similar, that
it's not really worth switching. Nevertheless, it's good to know about it.

# [prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/1.34/get-started/01-setting-up-prisma-new-database-TYPESCRIPT-t002/)

_Prisma_ is a a server backend that implements the
[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/code/) specification, as well as a powerful
client-side library for accessing such a server. As of 2019, it supports
TypeScript, JavaScript, Go and MySQL, PostgreSQL natively.

It is a nice-enough and simple to use tool for folks who are building
micro-service applications and do not wish to directly implement the GraphQL
specification themselves. A notable feature is the ability to design a schema
for your database and letting Prisma take care of its deployment.

# prometheus

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/first_steps/) is
a monitoring platform that collects metrics from monitored targets. It can
scrape API endpoints, it can pull/push data from clients in your favorite
languages and it has many plugins that make it possible for it to scrape things
like collectd.

It can be used to alert when metics are outside of operational ranges. It can
also be used to produce graphs. If one isn't satisfied with the graphs, one can
also use Grafana to create the graphs.

The main advantage of prometheus over something like Zabbix, for example, is
the fact it has a declarative configuration. I.e. you configure it using code
(or config file). No need to click through the GUI or something awful like that.
Obviously, if you wanted to have a config file, you wouldn't use Zabbix, but
Nagios instead, but still those are heavily geared towards a human using the
GUI. Prometheus is much better in a micro-service-oriented infrastructure.

# puppet

No, this has nothing to do with the _puppet master_ from Outlast (video game),
although a certain component called puppetmaster was involved at one point
or another. [Puppet](https://puppet.com/products/open-source-projects) is
a tool for automating server and other devices installation and setup (similar
to Ansible).

# pv

*   Although not called like that (based on the man page), pv is a progress
(or pipe?) visualizer, in that it can be used either an intermediary between two
processes communicating or asked to visualize the data transfer on a given PID
and File Descriptor (only works on Linux and when the file descriptor has either
a file or block device open  :).

```bash
$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/stdout bs=512 count=$(( 2 * 1024 * 1024 )) | pv | dd if=/dev/stdin of=/dev/null 1.00GiB 0:00:36 [27.8MiB/s] [ <=> ]

is an extension to the django Python web-building framework that allows one to
easily spin up RESTful application programming interfaces.

## dramatiq

[dramatiq](https://github.com/Bogdanp/dramatiq) is a distributed task processing
library for Python 3\. In other words, you can use it whenever you need to solve
a problem where you have some workers (processes, threads, machines) and you
have some tasks they should perform, but you don't want to micromanage them.
dramatiq also allows you to create pipelines (like you would in a shell,
i.e. one task's result is another task's input) or groups (group of tasks
need to all be finished before proceeding further). Internally it uses
a message broker, such as RabbitMQ or Redis (since those can be accessed
from multiple machines, that's where the _distributed_ comes from).

## pandas

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) is a fast, powerful, flexible and
easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of
the Python programming language.

# Programming

*   [Boundaries, by Gary Bernhardt](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries)
    *   Using simple values (as opposed to complex objects) not just for holding
    data, but also as the boundaries between components and subsystems. It moves
    through many topics: functional programming; mutability's relationship to
    OO; isolated unit testing with and without test doubles; and concurrency,
    to name some bar.

# Quotes (That Come In Handy)

*   "Adding resources to a late project makes it later." (aka Brook's Law)
*   "Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the Development Team, regardless of
    domains that need to be addressed like testing, architecture, operations,
    or business analysis" –
    [Scrum Guide](http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)
*   "There are no experts, there is only us" – Jeremy D. Miller
*   "In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but
    planning is indispensable." – Dwight D. Eisenhower
*   "It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add
    but when there is nothing left to take away." – Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
*   "If you work only on the problem at hand, you will get by for today. If you
    work on yourself, you will excel for a lifetime." – Jim Rohn
*   "Agile is highly disciplined and more difficult, requires more maturity,
    than waterfall." – Lise Hvatum
*   "It is impossible to create joint plans with people who strive for
    different goals.</span>" – Confucius
*   "Make decisions slowly by consensus, thoroughly considering all options;
    implement decisions rapidly." –
    [Toyota Way, #13](http://jesusgilhernandez.com/2014/07/06/the-toyota-way/)
*   "If we can only offer new value to our customers every six months, they’ll
    benefit slowly, we’ll benefit slowly, and, worst of all, we’ll learn slowly.
    That puts us all at risk." – Ron Jeffries
*   "Be quick, but don't hurry." – John Wooden
*   "The plan is to become a successful company in the right way. That is:
    have a product, have a market, and have customers who are buying your
    product." – Daniel "Danny" Mark Lewin
*   "A conference is a gathering of people who singly can do nothing, but
    together can decide that nothing can be done." – Fred Allen
*   "Goals may cause systematic problems for organizations due to narrowed
    focus, unethical behavior, increased risk taking, decreased cooperation,
    and decreased intrinsic motivation." – Daniel H. Pink
*   "The very presence of goals may lead employees to focus myopically on
    short-term gains and to lose sight of the potential devastating long-term
    effects on the organization." – Ordóñez et al., 2009
    *   Taken out of context, this might be misinterpreted as "goals are
        always bad". This relates to goals that are set by individuals other
        than the ones executing on them.
*   "Scrum is more like your mother-in-law. She will point out all your
    deficiencies and the things that are going wrong with you, but not fix
    them. You need to fix them yourself." – Jurgen De Smet
*   "The most successful people, the evidence shows, often aren't directly
    pursuing conventional notions of success. They're working hard and
    persisting through difficulties because of their internal desire to
    control their lives, learn about their world, and accomplish something
    that endures." – Daniel H. Pink
*   "That's how we are out of the box. If, at age fourteen or forty-three,
    we're passive and inert, that's not because it's our nature. It's because
    something flipped our default setting," – Daniel H. Pink
*   "The ultimate freedom for creative groups is the freedom to experiment with
    mnew ideas. Some skeptics insist that innovation is expensive. In the long
    run, innovation is cheap. Mediocrity is expensive-- and autonomy can be the
    antidote." – Tom Kelley
*   "Perhaps it's time to toss the very word 'management' onto the linguistic
    ash heap alongside 'icebox' and 'horseless carriage'. This era doesn't call
    for better management. It calls for a renaissance of self-direction." –
    Daniel H. Pink
*   "Those men and women to whom we delegate authority and responsibility, if
    they are good people, are going to want to do their jobs in their own way."
    – William McKnight
*   "The desire to do something because you find it deeply satisfying and
    personally challenging inspires the highest levels of creativity, whether
    it's in the arts, science, or business." – Teresa Amabile
*   "Figure out for yourself what you want to be really good at, know that
    you'll never really satisfy yourself that you've made it, and accept that
    that's okay." – Robert B. Reich
*   "One cannot lead a life that is truly excellent without feeling that one
    belongs to something greater and permanent than oneself." – Mihaly
    Csikszentmihalyi
*   "Be prepared to cut your losses – canceling bad projects early is success
    because you save time, talent, money and resources that can be applied
    to better opportunities." – Ian Spence and Kurt Bittner
*   "Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex... It takes
    a touch of genius - and a lot of courage to move in the opposite
    direction." – "Small is Beautiful", by E.F. Shumacher
*   "Your work is shit." – Steve Jobs, interview with Bob Cringely
    *   Bob Cringely: "What does it mean when you tell someone their work
        is shit?"
    *   Steve Jobs:
        *   "It usually means their work is shit. Sometimes it means,
            'I think your work is shit. And I – I'm wrong'".
        *   "The most important thing I think yo can do for somebody who's
            really good and who's really being counted on is to point out
            to them when their work isn't good enough. And to do it very clearly
            and to articulate why ... and to get them back on track."
*   "When you have to fire people, do it with humility. Remember, the reason
    you have to fire them is not that they suck. It's not even that they suck
    at this job. It's that this job–the job you gave them–sucks for them." –
    Kim Scott
*   If no mistake have you made, yet losing you are… a different game you
    should play. -- Yoda
*   "The client or sponsor is the driver, yes, and has brought resources
    to bear to accomplish this goal that you’re managing, but you were not
    brought on to be a “yes” person.  (If you were, then stop reading right
    now and go find another job.  You’re in an unhealthy situation!)" –

    people to work." – Peter Drucker
*   "If you don't change, you die!" – by Herb Kelleher
*   "Yes, we want to play football, we really like it...but let’s be pragmatic
    about it, the “by the book” football doesn’t really fit our context. So we
    will do 3 hours long matches because our players need more time to score.
    Also we don’t need trainer for our players, we will just tell them when to
    hit the ball and how (plus they saw a video about football and few of them
    are certified players now l). Also the ball is too hard for our players
    so we will use a beach ball and make the goals bigger. And goalkeeper will
    be a temporary role." – by Karel Slatinský
*   "Simple, clear purpose and principles give rise to complex and intelligent
    behavior. Complex rules and regulations give rise to simple and stupid
    behavior." – by Dee Hock

    Scotland
*   "The first thing you’ll see is, much like you do with an
    application, **you’re not going to have 1 super-app that represents the

*   "We regularly coach groups that ask, 'How can we calculate how many people

    *   ex: "Every productive behavior starts with a conscious choice. I want
    you to start the day by deciding that non-work activities will not be an option
    during your designated work time. Believe me, once you allow non-work
    activities to invade your work time, the easier it becomes to do it
    again, and again. Next, adopt this rule. No personal calls, emails,
    texts, instant messages, and so on. Yes, emergencies happen but they're
    rare and you need to protect your work time. Not only do I want you to
    refrain from sending personal messages, I want you to try and not receive
    them either."

# salt

[Salt](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/) is:

*   A configuration management system. Salt is capable of maintaining remote
    nodes in defined states. For example, it can ensure that specific packages
    are installed and that specific services are running.
*   A distributed remote execution system used to execute commands and query
    data on remote nodes. Salt can query and execute commands either on
    individual nodes or by using an arbitrary selection criteria.

Seems like Salt is basically Ansible with state, that is not Ansible Tower :).
They both use Python and YAML.

# socat – establish two bidirectional byte streams to transfer data between them

**[Socat](http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/doc/socat.html)** is
a command-line-based utility that establishes two bidirectional byte streams
and transfers data between them. Because the streams can be constructed from
a large set of different types of data sinks and sources (incl. SSL).

# [sococo](https://www.sococo.com/)

Sococo is a company/product that attempts to bridge the gap between being just
a unified communications tool and a kinda virtual reality for remote work
environments (with a grain of salt).

Basically, the selling point is that with you team/organization, you can create
a layout/map of your workplace (including seats, conference rooms, kitchens, ...)
and have your colleagues kinda roam around that workplace and interact with others,
should they feel like it (it's also possible to sit in a phone booth for just one
person).

I find this interesting, since using simple text/emoji statuses in a unified messaging
app is definitely not enough -- I never know when others are engaged in some kind of discussion,
but simply just type (as opposed to being in some kind of room/area that anyone can join), or
whether they are truly available (their status might show available, even though they are in
a room/area and are actively engaged with people -- sococo should make it obvious where they are).

# team building (games)

## Human Knot

Equipment: **none**
Time: **15 - 30 minutes**
Number of Participants: **8 - 20 people** (with less, it's not so exciting)

Rules: Have everyone stand in a circle facing each other, shoulder to shoulder.
Instruct everyone to put their right hand out and grab a random hand of someone
across from them. Then, tell them to put their left hand out and grab another
random hand from a different person across the circle. Within a set time limit,
the group needs to untangle the knot of arms without releasing their hands. If
the group is too large, make multiple smaller circles and have the separate
groups compete.

_Objective: This game for team building relies heavily on good communication
and teamwork. It also results in a lot of great stories for the water cooler
chat in the workplace._

## The Perfect Square

Equipment: **blind folds and 2 (or more) ropes**
Time: **15 - 30 minutes**
Number of Participants: **5 - 20 people**

Rules: Lay the ropes in a straight line in front of each team. Have the teams
stand side by side behind the rope. Have everyone take a step or two back away
from the rope. Next, ask everyone to come back and try to form a square with
the rope without removing their blindfolds. Set a time limit to make it more
competitive. To make it even more difficult, instruct some team members to stay
silent.

_Objective: Focuses on strong communication and leadership skills. By
instructing some team members to be silent, this game also requires an element
of trust across the team, allowing team members to guide each other in the
right direction._

## Blind Draw

Equipment: **flipchart (or clipboard)**, **papers, crayons (or pencils or
pens), photos/pictures to draw (or some assortment of every day objects)
**Time: **15-30 minutes
**Number of Participants: **4-20 people**

Rules:

1\. Get a flipchart (or clipboard), markers, pencils, crayons or pens, and
a bunch of random pictures. This game works best with more unobvious objects
(say, a trampoline vs a coin).
2\. Divide all participants into teams of 4-6 people.
3\. Ask each team to pick one person to be the "artist". Ask the artists to
take their place next to the flipchart.
4\. Face the teams away from the flipcharts and present them all with one
(the same) picture.
5\. The teams will then instruct their artists on how to draw the picture based
on verbal instructions alone. They can describe the object but not state its
name. The artist can't see the object at any time, nor can the team see what
the artist is drawing.
6\. The team whose drawing comes closest to the actual object wins.

## Photo Finish

Equipment: **rope (or measuring or masking tape or long stick)**
Time: **15-30 minutes**
Number of Participants: **5-20 people**

Rules:

1\. Create a straight 'finish line' using the rope.
2\. Ask all participants to cross the finish line at exactly the same time,
i.e. a "photo finish". Participants will have to coordinate with each other
to pull this off.
3\. Take a photograph or take a video every time they cross the finish line to
see if it qualifies as a photo finish.
4\. For added difficulty, ask the participants to walk or run across the finish
line in a photo finish.

## Team Emblem/Crest

Equipment: **papers, crayons (or pencils or pens)**
Time: **15-30 minutes**
Number of Participants: **4-20 people**

1\. Grab cardboard, chart paper, markers, crayons, tape or anything else you'll
need to draw and paint a team emblem or team shield.
2\. Divide players into small teams of 3-4 people each. You can make the team
composition the same as your real-life office teams to focus more on the team
identity aspects of this activity.  
3\. Give each team enough time to plan, draw and paint an emblem for their
teams. The emblem must represent something the identifies the team and its
values. They get 10 minutes for inspiration (they can look up ideas online if
  they want to), 20-80 minutes to make the emblem.
4\. Once the time is up, ask each team to display their emblem. Invite all other
teams to give their own interpretation of the emblem. Then the creating team
gives their actual interpretation. Repeat the process for all other teams.

# teleconsole

[Teleconsole](https://www.teleconsole.com/using/) is a tool for enabling remote
access to local services, similar to ngrok. Teleconsole is different in that it
allows the other party to directly control a terminal session (with the
possibility of even being able to forward ports over the protocol), such that
both of you can actively participate in the session. (It's more or less like
a shared tmux panel over SSH or web interface).

# telegraf

[Telegraf](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.11/introduction/getting-started)
is an agent (written in Go) for collecting metrics and writing/sending them into
various outputs. Similar tools include CollectD for instance. It has many
plugins that facilitate its metric collection as well as storage capabilities.
For example,
the [nginx](https://www.influxdata.com/integration/nginx-monitoring-tools/)
plugin can be used to collect _requests per second, response times, active
connections, ..._ and you can ingest the metrics into
[Prometheus](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/outputs/prometheus_client).

# terraform

*   [Terraform.io](https://www.terraform.io/) is in infrastructure as a code
    solution that allows one to specify how one's infrastructure is supposed to
    look like, and Terraform makes it happen. It supports many different cloud
    providers as well as virtualization platforms, and others.
    *   Terraform is the answer to the people who don't want the hassle of
        interfacing with APIs directly (i.e. using boto3 or similar tools) and
        want one more level of abstraction.

## gulpfile.js

This is a boiler-plate-free example `gulpfile.js` suitable for use with NodeJS.
It expects all your sources to live under `src`, and will produce their
equivalent JavaScript files in `dist`. It also expects a working Babel and
ESLint setup.

The main two targets to use from the outside are `cleanBuild` and
`buildAndWatch` (spawning a loop watching the sources and recompiling when they
change).

```javascript
const gulp = require("gulp");
const typescript = require("gulp-typescript");
const eslint = require("gulp-eslint");
const sourcemaps = require("gulp-sourcemaps");
const babel = require("gulp-babel");
const del = require("del");
const cached = require("gulp-cached");

exports.clean = gulp.parallel(
  function deleteDist() {
    return del(["dist"]);
  },
  function deletePackage() {
    return del(["package"]);
  }
);

const tsProject = typescript.createProject("tsconfig.json");

exports.build = gulp.series(function buildTypescript() {
  return tsProject
    .src()
    .pipe(cached("dist"))
    .pipe(eslint())
    .pipe(eslint.format())
    .pipe(eslint.failAfterError())
    .pipe(sourcemaps.init())
    .pipe(tsProject())
    .js.pipe(babel())
    .pipe(sourcemaps.write())
    .pipe(gulp.dest("dist"));
});

exports.cleanBuild = gulp.series(exports.clean, exports.build);

exports.buildAndWatch = gulp.series([exports.cleanBuild], function watch() {
  return gulp.watch("src/**/*.ts", exports.build);
});
```

## .eslintrc.js

This is a boiler-plate-free example .eslintrc.js suitable for use with NodeJS.
It also includes Prettier rules, to make sure you run it against your files :).

```javascript
module.exports = {
  parser: "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  plugins: ["@typescript-eslint"],
  extends: [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended",
    "prettier/@typescript-eslint",
    // PRETTIER NEEDS TO BE THE LAST ONE
    "plugin:prettier/recommended"
  ],
  env: {
    node: true,
    es6: true
  },
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 2019,
    sourceType: "module"
  },
  rules: {}
};
```

## jest & typescript

* [ts-jest](https://kulshekhar.github.io/ts-jest/user/config/)

## tsconfig.json

This is a boiler-plate-free example `tsconfig.json` suitable for use with
NodeJS. It expects all your sources to live under src and will produce their
equivalent JavaScript files into `dist`.

  "compilerOptions": {
    "declaration": true,

presented by Windows in the control panel, going through the secret settings (that
one has to first enable), and ending up with 3rd-party apps to do the job.

Turns out, preventing Windows from falling asleep on a laptop computer is suspiciously
hard. It seems somewhat doable if you don't plan to ever enable the lock screen (which
you should, because there's no need to keep the computer fully accessible when you
might be in the other room). But when Windows gets to the lock screen, it seems
(despite being told not to) to always decide it's time to go to sleep.

My recommendation is then either [Don't sleep](http://www.softwareok.com/?seite=Microsoft/DontSleep)
or [Caffeine](https://zhornsoftware.co.uk/caffeine/). They just do the job. No need to fiddle with
a gazillion of configuration options. And you can still lock the computer and it won't go to sleep :).

"xonsh is a shell language and command prompt. Unlike other shells, xonsh is
based on Python, with additional syntax added that makes calling subprocess
commands, manipulating the environment, and dealing with the file system easy.
The xonsh command prompt gives users interactive access to the xonsh language."
